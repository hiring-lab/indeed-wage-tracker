# Indeed Wage Tracker

This repository contains the data behind the *Indeed Hiring Lab's* Wage Tracker data product. The data is updated monthly, with the exact timing depending upon Hiring Lab’s publication schedule.

We currently publish country-level trends for 9 countries: the UK, the US, Canada, and six euro-area countries — France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain — that jointly account for over 80% of euro-area employment.

## Methodology

The data in this repository are the average year-on-year percentage changes in wages and salaries advertised in job postings on Indeed, controlling for job titles.

To calculate the average rate of wage growth, we follow an approach similar to the Atlanta Fed [US Wage Growth Tracker](https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker), but we are tracking job titles, not individuals. We begin by calculating the median posted wage for each country, month, job title, region and salary type (hourly, monthly or annual). Within each country, we then calculate year-on-year wage growth for each job title-region-salary type combination, generating a monthly distribution. Our monthly measure of wage growth for the country is the median of that distribution. The data are not seasonally adjusted.

More information about the data and methodology is available in our accompanying research paper, [“Wage growth in Europe: evidence from job ads”](https://www.centralbank.ie/docs/default-source/publications/economic-letters/wage-growth-europe-evidence-job-ads.pdf) (Adrjan and Lydon, 2022), published in the Central Bank of Ireland’s Economic Letter series. We adopted this methodology in October 2022.
